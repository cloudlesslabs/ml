# CLOUDLESS OPEN LABS - MACHINE LEARNING

This library implements common machine learning and linear algebra algorithms. It is built upon the following dependencies:
- [@rayyamhk/matrix](https://github.com/rayyamhk/Matrix.js): A lightweight implementation of matrix operations such as QR, LU, eigenvalues, rank, ...
- [svd-js](https://github.com/danilosalvati/svd-js): A lightweight implementation of the SVD decomposition.
